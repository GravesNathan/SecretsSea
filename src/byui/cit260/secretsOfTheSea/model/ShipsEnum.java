    /*
    I hope to change the Ships Class to this enum if time permits.
    This will first require having selected ship hold it's own stats instead
    of being a sub class.
    
    It will require an adjustment of the ship choice
    to associate that choice with the appropriate keyword.  If the 
    ship choice we store in the model layer is a String matchinig the
    keywords we can then use such in a foreach.  This would be a for-each
    function to have ship : Ships and if shipName matches the selectedShipName
    it wouuld adjust the stats to create the selected ship.
    
    Not exactly a simple 1,2,3 so maybe later.
